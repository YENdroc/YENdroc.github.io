<h3> Confirmation and Determinations</h3>
<h4> (1.)</h4>
<ul>
        <li> \begin{align}  &= \frac{1}{0.6687917203} \hspace{.2cm}\frac{minutes}{rotations} \\ \frac{seconds}{rotations} &= \frac{minutes}{rotations} 
        * \frac{seconds}{minutes} \\ 
        89.71406956 \hspace{.2cm}\frac{seconds}{rotations} &= \frac{1}{0.6687917203} * \frac{60}{1} \\ \\ \\
        89.71406956 \hspace{.2cm}seconds &= 1 \hspace{.2cm}rotation\end{align}</li>
        <li>\begin{align}  1000 * 89.71406956 \hspace{.2cm}seconds &= 1000 * 1 \hspace{.2cm}rotation \\ 87914.06956 \hspace{.2cm}seconds &=
         1 \hspace{.2cm}kilo-rotation \\ 87914.06956 \hspace{.2cm}seconds * \frac{1}{3600} \frac{hour}{seconds} &= 1 \hspace{.2cm}kilo-rotation \\ \\ \\
         24.9205 \hspace{.2cm}hours &= 1 \hspace{.2cm}kilo-rotation 
           \end{align} </li>
</ul>

<h4> (2.)</h4>
<p> A Earth equivalent to 12 24-hour periods would be a fotnight. Though, this is an old english words that means 14 nights, it is only 2 24.9-hour-periods off from
    Drasilian's time convention. A Earth equivalent to 1 annum would be a year. This convention of time in the Drasilian's spaceship leaves us with the
    Earth week equivalent being shorter that the Drasilian's fortnight but Earth's year is slightly longer than Drasilian's annum    </p>

<h4> (3.)</h4>
<p> I believe these convention of basing time around the rotations of the ship is very reasonable. It make practical sense but I would imagine that the ship would not be always
    rotate at the same speed for the entire duration of the ships journey. Considering this is a fantasy world, it is entirely possible to have the ship maintain 
the exact same rotation speed for this journey but I will consider this not being the case. What I think may take this timing convention  a step further is to base time around some nuclear 
mechanism. May it be nuclear decay or some other nuclear interaction. I believe ths may will leave room for less error and maybe be useful in scientific cases. I would 
try to find how long it takes for a certain element to decay into another within a minute, then use Earth's time convention to get a 24 hour equivalent, week and year equivalent.  </p>

<h3> Adding Human Details</h3>
<ul>
    <li> I imagine that Drasilian's try their hardest to sync their time schedules with each other and by doing so they attempt to conform to this time 
        convention. Things like school, daily maintenance, hobbies, and socializing I would imagine would happen in the same 12-hour period as normal Earth-2025 
        does.  
    </li>
    <li> I do think it is a good idea to keep semblance to seasons, studies do show that seasons do have a impact on 
        <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/article/44541/human-influence-detected-changing-seasons">human behavior pattern</a>. I do believe that traditional 
        Earth holidays would not be celebrated. For (1) I don't believe that most people in the annum 177 would remember Earth holidays and if they did 
        they certainly would not celebrate it the same way it was celebrated on Earth  
        </li>
