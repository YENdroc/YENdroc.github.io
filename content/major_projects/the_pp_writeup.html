        <h2>Problem Setup</h2>
        <p>Imagine a stack of standard letter paper (8.5 in × 11 in) that has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …, 1,000,000,000 typed out on them in 12 pt font. Each piece of paper has the number followed by a space, the next number, another space, the next number, and so on, going from one to one billion.</p>

        <h4>The start of the first page:</h4>

        <pre>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 
35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 …
        </pre>

        <p>Every time a page is filled up, it is added to the stack of papers. At the end of this process,</p>
        <p><strong>How tall is the stack of papers?</strong></p>

        <h2>List of Assumptions Made with Justification</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The page has a 1 in margin</li>
            <li>The space and line spacing are the same as the example set.(As seen on the printed prompt sheet.)</li>
            <li> Same font on each page (As seen on the printed prompt sheet.)</li>
            <li> The space between the top of the first row and the bottom of the third row is .5 in</li>
            <li> 50 lines per page</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>


        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number per Line = 85 </li>
                <li>Lines per Page = 50</li>
                <li>Number per Page = 85 * 50 = 4250</li>
                <li> Pages = 1billion / 4250</li>
                <li> Page Thickness = 0.004 in = 0.0001016 m </li>
                <li> Stack Height = Pages * 0.0001016 m = 23.9 m </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Sources of Error</h2>
        <p>Think of the sources of error in your estimate and describe them here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The varying white space at the end of lines, dues to a number (say 1500) not fitting on a line</li>
            <li>Some number are wider than others, like 0 and 1, this may cause cartain lines to not fit as many characters as physically possible</li>
            <li> The thickness of each page may vary, so I said  σ = 0.1mm</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What was the most challenging part of solving this problem?</li>
            - The hardest part was trying to consider everyones' idea as much as mines. At first I wanted to purley go with what I imagined, but after consider their solution I came to like their solution and plan more than my own's.  
            <li>Did the 1-minute solution explanation with a partner and then grouping up with other classmates help you?</li>
            - It help we realize what was more important and what was less important in my solution plan.
            <ul>
                <li>What part of this process was useful for you, and how did it help?</li>
                - The group discussion was the most useful to me. It simply helped me realize what I may have been lacking in my solution plan. 
            </ul>
            <li>Talk about how you think you did with collaboration.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>What role did you take in your group?</li>
                - I believe I took the role of being a person to bounce ideas off of. 
                <li>Was the workload and idea generation evenly distributed?</li>
                - The idea generation was evenly distributed, but piecing them together was mostly the work of another group member. 
                <li>Did you listen to your groupmates?</li>
                - I did indeed listen to my groupmates. 
            </ul>
        </ol>
