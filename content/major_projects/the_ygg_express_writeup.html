    <h5 style="text-align: left;"> The first route I choose is gryb, the reason I choose this route is because it visually looks the shortest.

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Reflection: </h3>

<p> 
    A big part of this challenge problem that I had trouble with was determining what would be considered the shortest path. Using the two solution paths I came 
    up with in the solution map above, I mainly thought about routes that I believed minimized time and distance. There is slightly suspicion that I may be thinking 
    about the entire thing wrong. Maybe by finding the shortest distance from the distance formula that path may be the one that minimizes times, and my solution map 
    just restates the same information twice but given in two different forms.
</p>

<p> 
    There is no extensive logic behind the two path i choose. For the first route, I started by going to the package that I believed minimized my first step, from there I choose the package that
    visually looks the closest. For the second route I more or less had the same logic but I choose to start with the second closet first step and attempt minimize
    the route from yellow to red to green.
</p>

<p> 
    Before any calculations is done I believe that the first route is the shortest path and fastest path route. I say this because it has less steps compared to the
    second route.
