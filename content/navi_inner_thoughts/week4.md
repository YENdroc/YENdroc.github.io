## **Week 4 Reflection**  

### **Prompt 1:**  
##### Problem Solving  
*When it comes to solving problems, whether those be math-based problems or life problems, what are your weaknesses? Jot down a few ideas of how you might work on improving on those weaknesses*  

- My weakness may be doubting what I put or over thinking what the question is asking. Lately I have been tryng to explicitly consider either conflicts with others, problems sets in class or whatever as exactly as they are. Mainly I over complicate things too often and it messes with my ability to solve a problem.   

### **Prompt 2:**  
##### Critical Thinking & Analysis  
*What is known and unknown about something we have discussed, covered, or worked on in class recently? Where are the gaps and the ambiguity? 
Glory in the gaps and reveal in the ambiguity.*  

- There isn't anything I am confused about, So far the math and physics in this class have been tame.

### **Prompt 3:**  
##### Collaboration  
*On a scale of 1 to 10, ten being best, how well do you feel you demonstrated respect for the opinions, views, and ideas of your other team members? Explain your rating and what a few points higher and lower (if applicable) would have been for you.*  

- I feel I have given a 10. I feel in the moments we have had collaborative work I have been super considering of my teams opinions and/ or ideas.

### **Prompt 4:**  
##### Research  
*Pick a topic you are interested in and want to learn more about. Find and list 3 primary sources related to your interest. Describe your thought process and how you felt in trying to find 3 relevant sources.*  

- [Quantum Supremacy using a Programmable Superconducting Processor](https://research.google/pubs/quantum-supremacy-using-a-programmable-superconducting-processor/)
- [Google and NASA Achieve Quantum Supremacy](https://www.nasa.gov/technology/computing/google-and-nasa-achieve-quantum-supremacy/)
- [Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5)

   - I was interesting in Quantum Supremacy, and I didnt believe there was a way to get a primiary source in this topic but i was mostly looking for sites where I believed they and a reasonably close relationship with they people putting in the work to achieve what is known as "Quantum Supremacy."
