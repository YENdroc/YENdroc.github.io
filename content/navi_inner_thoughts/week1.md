## **Week 1 Reflection**


### **Prompt 1:**  
*When it comes to learning, what works the best for you?*  

- If I had to use a single word, I would use "Reinforce." If I were to use more words, I would describe it as preparing myself by first knowing what it is I am learning at a particular time. This means that at the beginning of the semester, I would watch YouTube videos on subjects that I know are going to be covered. By doing this, I feel I get a reasonable introduction to the subject before I receive a formal introduction in class. After the formal introduction, I often comfortably understand the subject. This method has been crafted throughout my five years of undergrad.  

### **Prompt 2:**  
*Out of the skill categories, which do you think you are best at? Which do you think you need to work on the most?*  

- Connection is my weakest skill. I feel this way for various reasons, but compared to other skills, I need to work on this one the most. The skill I feel I am best at is problem-solving. I know when there is a challenge, and as long as I am interested, I can solve it.  

### **Prompt 3:**  
*What is something that puts you into a “flow state” where you don’t realize the passage of time and you can easily say that you were enjoying yourself while being engrossed in what you are doing?*  

- I don’t know exactly what puts me in my "flow state," but I do know I feel in flow state mostly in challenging situations, usually when in competition with others—such as gaming—or when I am solving a particular coding problem.  

### **Prompt 4:**  
*What does good work look like?*  

- Good work looks like putting your best foot forward at all times and being overly willing to adapt to ensure the best outcome for the situation and/or yourself (and others).
