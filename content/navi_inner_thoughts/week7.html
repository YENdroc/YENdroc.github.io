    <h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 1: </h3>
    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Creativity + Connection + Habits</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >

        This week's Prompt of the Week focuses on getting you to play around creating a Yggdrasil World 
        character for yourself. Instead of just creating one, however, you are going to create two. Create one character in the 
        Yggdrasil World that is a representation of who you would like to be in such a world. 
        Describe who they are, what they do with their time, and their basic values and personality. Create another character of someone in this world 
        who you would admire and strive to be like. Again, describe who they are, what they do with their time, and their basic values and personality. 
    </p>
   
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>
                <ol> <h5>NAVI NOWU</h5>
                    <li> I imagine my character to essentially be myself in the real world. Navi would be a mildly introvert who has interests in STEM related subjects, 
                        FPS games, fighting games, basketball, cycling, and sorts. I imagine him to be a engineer who spends their times working with STEVEN on important thing,
                        spending quality time with a significant other, and site seeing into space. I would want my character to be known as reliable and trustworthy so I would add that in
                        addition to my current qualities like problem-solving, calm headed-ness, determination, pattern recognition, Navi would be a real go getter and goal oriented person. 
                     </li>

                      <h5>TAYLOR NOWU</h5>
                     <li> In this world Taylor would be Navi's wife. I imagine Taylor to be determined, soft hearted, no-BS taking women who has reasonable 
                        similar interest as Navi. She may like doing things like swimming, watching badly written TV shows, painting and running. I would want 
                        this person to be akin to a Social worker on the ship. So I'd imagined they have strong morals about protecting kids and advocating for those 
                        who may not always be able to advocate for themselves.   </li>
                
                </ol>

            </li>
        
    </ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 2: </h3>
    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Problem Solving</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Describe a problem-solving process you engaged with recently in the class. What did you do well? What could you improve on?
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;"> 
        <li> The most recent problem-solving process I engaged with was the Yggdrasil Express Problem. I think I did a decent job on visualizing the 
            route needed to complete the job. I was able to visualize two distinct routes that I believed minimized time and distance. Even though I did decent 
            on that portion I could have improved on was determining how the relation ship with minimizing time and minimizing distance. As a physicist I believe 
            I should some relative ease with understanding it but I do believe I could have done better.  
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 3: </h3>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Critical Thinking & Analysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Describe your reasoning for what, how, and why your thinking about a recent course topic is the way it is.
    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> In the last few class sessions we have been preparing for the world building portion of the class. In this portion I decided I wanted to build
            upon the social environment of the Yggdrasil. I plan to first understand what it is would a human living on a space ship would value and what 
            sort of challenges or conflicts may a society face in this environment face. I believe this was important because given our real-world political 
            climate, I feel my mind naturally wanted to try and "fix" the issues in a made up world.    
          </li>
        
    </ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 4: </h3>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Collaboration</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Consider some of your recent group work. What steps did you take to constructively build on the work of your teammates?
    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> The most recent group work I participated in was for my Modern Optics class. During the laboratory portion My lab partner was able to get into
            the lab before I was able to. During this time they started a reasonable portion of the lab, and once I was able to make it I asked if they would 
            let me finish the lab. I believe this allowed me to one: be fair to my lab partner, two: gain the experience expected of me from this lab, and three: 
            build off what it is my partner created and measured. 
          </li>
        
    </ul>
