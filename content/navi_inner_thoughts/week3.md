## **Week 3 Reflection**  

### **Prompt 1:**  
##### Problem Solving  
*Think about a problem related to class that you have been working on. Identify some mistakes you have made in your attempts to find solutions, and discuss some adaptations to your approach(es) that might lead to more progress.*  

- A problem that relates to this class that I had a particular hard time on was attempting to implement a comment system into my website. I first attempted to use a more complex method by going with a option called [StaticMan](https://staticman.net/), this option takes comments submitted, have a bot write that comment to a static file and update it in you github repository, so essential the comment is now apart of you rendered website. This option was too complicated so I went with Cusdis a open source option that allows for Cusdis to host server that stores the comments and a dynamic .html form allows for approved comments to be published. 

### **Prompt 2:**  
##### Critical Thinking & Analysis  
*Why do we (humanity or our class) or you care about this topic or project? What is the “so what” for the topic or project?*  

- I care about this website because it is like a personal project that I can use to become better at coding, developing Websites, using Hugo, and just improving my overal R&D skills.

### **Prompt 3:**  
##### Collaboration  
*Identify and describe a few ways in which you could better communicate and work with your team during group work.*  

- I could just try to not be in my head so much and just do whats best for my overall development and not care too much what others may think.  

### **Prompt 4:**  
##### Research  
*What are some challenges you faced in searching for primary sources for work you’ve done in this class? How did you overcome them, or do these challenges remain?*  

- Consider the book Project Hail Mary. After hearing classmates talk about how good the book was I decided to look at reviews for the book. Surprising a lot of people have either reviewed the book on Google Reviews, Reddit, or various blog sites. For most of what I have seen the reviews have been good.
