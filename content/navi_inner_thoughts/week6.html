    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Problem Solving + Critical Thinking + Creativity</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >

        Take a technology or device that currently has a large impact on our society. Speculate on a futuristic equivalent to this technology that
        could exist on the Yggdrasil. To keep things from being Steven-
        dominated, consider that this is a technology that existed before
        Steven became sentient. In a short passage, describe what the
        technology is, what the current analogous technology is, and
        some of how it is used by Drasilians.

    </p>
   
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> Consider current binary computers, a future equivalent that is technically currently in development are quantum computers. I instantly think 
            of a popular television show called "The Orville." In this show the main cast are aboard a ship that essentially acts as an explorer that 
            is meant to chart unexplored areas in space. On this ship they have a simulation room that is capable of simulating realistic environments. 
            Drasilians would use the quantum computer in a similar fashion. As I understand it now quantum computers are expected to be used to essentially solve 
            super complex problems, and aboard the Yggdrasil a quantum computer would work in similar fashion. I imagine it as the quantum computer quickly solve 
            dymanatic problems like leaves flowing in the wind, a rock falling off a build, or a car swerving a corner. This would allow one to simulate any world
            see fit and in create a world in the way they see fit. 
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Problem Solving</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Think of one of the problems you are currently working on in this class and go through the
         "<a href="https://www.mural.co/templates/five-whys-worksheet"> Five Whys </a>" exercise 
         or "<a href="https://www.mural.co/templates/abstraction-laddering"> Abstract Laddering  </a>" exercise.
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
         When using the Abstract Laddering Method: 
        <li> Step 1: I am in the process of creating a aspect of the Yggdrasil world to build upon. Specifically I want to explore the ideas of the
            potential religions that may appear aboard the ship. 
        </li>
        <li> Step 2: Why? I believe this is a very real thing to think about. As humans we tend to take simple believe to the extreme and some times 
            it can come to feel like a religion. Think of American football and the culture surroundings that.
        </li>
        <li> Step 3: Some boarder concepts that may entail this is when, how , or if at all where do the humans aboard the ship interact with other Drasilians.
            To be specific I am referring to when at all do Drasilians, say in the first habitant ring, interact with Drasilians in the other habitant ring.
            If at all how do the Drasilians interact with people they may not see on a consistent basis. Where do these interactions happen, if at all. 
        </li>
        <li> Step 4: I guess I would like to come up with a system that will ensure that future generations will live with each other in reasonable harmony. 
            Humans tend to ostracized other humans that are not within their immediate area.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 3: </h3>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Critical Thinking & Analysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Can you identify any biases that you are bringing to the work you are currently doing, or have recently completed, 
        in the class? Describe what the bias youâ€™ve been holding is and what you need to do to overcome it.
    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> A bias I believe I am bringing to work is assuming my class mates may not relate to who I am as much as I think. Although we do have our
            differences there are a reasonable amount of things I believe me and my class mates have in common.  
          </li>
        
    </ul>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 4: </h3>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Collaboration</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Consider some of your recent group work. What is one change you could make 
        in the way you listen and respond to the opinions, views, and ideas of your teammates that would make your team more effective?
    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> To make a team I am apart of more effective I can simply be more outgoing. I believe that is showed by being more curious by being willing to 
            collaborate with others who may not directly be in my group and just overall by having more confidence. When a team member bring up an idea 
            I could ask them to elaborate further, this way I maybe able to further understand where they are coming from and maybe they will do the same. 
            In the end we both may just understand each other better and are able to collaborate better.    
          </li>
        
    </ul>
