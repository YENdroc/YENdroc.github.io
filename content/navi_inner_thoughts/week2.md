## **Week 2 Reflection**  

### **Prompt 1:**  
##### Problem Solving  
*Reflect on one of the problems we recently encountered in class. What were the challenges you faced in solving the problem? Can you identify the “crux” (or cruces) of the problem that were most difficult for you? Why do you think that part of the problem was hard for you?*  

- In the case of the Paper Problem, there was no specific situation where I felt there was a "crux" that was too difficult. Although this isn’t necessarily a crux, I do believe I had the most trouble when trying to perform calculations in my head. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at ORNL with some physicists. One of the biggest pieces of advice they gave us as undergraduate physicists was to be able to perform relatively complex decision-making and calculations swiftly in our heads. I do believe this is a valuable skill, but all my life, this has been a particularly difficult skill to master.  

### **Prompt 2:**  
##### Critical Thinking & Analysis  
*In the work you have been doing, what assumptions have you been making? How are these assumptions influencing your thinking?*  

- In the work I have been doing so far in this class, an assumption I have been making is that all the work I do in this class is strictly to benefit and advance the skills I want to develop. I realize that at the beginning of this class, the professor informed us that the class is self-graded and that technically all the work we are doing is for ourselves. What I am doing is actually trying to believe just that. After being in school for ~20 years, having a self-graded and self-fulfilling class is a very new idea to me, and I am trying to fully understand and embrace it.  

### **Prompt 3:**  
##### Collaboration  
*Describe and analyze the ways in which you have interacted with your team members in both positive and negative ways on recent group work in the class.*  

- This is the second semester, so I have not interacted with group members too often this semester. But one positive interaction I had was with Devilin (or something similar) during our group interview assignment. I learned that Devilin likes to engineer things. He told me that after high school, he had taken spare parts from his dad's garage and built a Tony Stark-esque arm shooter. From my understanding, it shoots hot air. What made this a positive experience was simply getting to know a little extra about a team member. I truly cannot say I have had a negative experience with any team members in this class so far.  

### **Prompt 4:**  
##### Research  
*Reflect on a literature search you recently did related to your work in class. Sample questions to respond to include, but are not limited to: What strategies did you find effective in locating relevant sources? How did these sources help you explore your area of interest or curiosity?*  

- Although this wasn’t for this class but rather for PHY494 (Intro to Machine Learning), I did some simple research about activation functions. Strategies I used to find relevant sources included simply searching on YouTube. YouTube has an abundance of material on literally anything. From watching these videos, I was able to pick up on some jargon. From this point, I felt (1) I was able to comfortably start my project and (2) I could ask the right questions to get the help I needed at the time.
