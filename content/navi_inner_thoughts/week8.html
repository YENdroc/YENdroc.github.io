        Build a pitch for what you think would be a basis for an interesting story to be told in the Yggdrasil 
        World. You do not have to include all of them, but generic elements of a story are: plot (sequence of events); 
        characters, setting, conflict, theme, and point of view. What is your idea for an interesting story? Who is involved? 
        What are they doing?  You don't have to have the plot worked out. I would rather you emphasize the overall idea for something interesting.

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> In the early early days of the Apparitionist, Steven didn't fully understand what it is they were understanding. One human, who initially may have been behind
            the start of the Apparitionist cult, specifically asked Steven to "dumb" down his appearance to certain individuals with the intention of casting them to the bottom
            of the social totem pole. This can go wrong because in the eye of non-Apparitionist Steven is siding with one human against another. This could possibly lead
            to a faction of uneducated people outright not liking Steven at all. During all of this Steven would notice the sudden change in attitude towards it's persons
             would seek out SoPHIL to attempt to remedy the situation. From here SoPHL helps smooths things over but the effects stills last.

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Problem Solving</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Consider a problem in this class you have recently encountered. 
        Is there a picture, diagram, or figure that might help you find a solution? (Donâ€™t use this prompt if the answer is no). Create that graphic. 
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;"> 
        <li> As I am using HTML, and cannot figure out how to attach images, <a href = https://vitalysthealth.org/the-wheel/ > here </a> is the link to the picture I am unable to display. 
            At this link there is a graph that shows the components that a healthy society may desire. 
        </li>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 3: </h3>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Critical Thinking & Analysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Pick something about this class that you have been thinking about recently. 
        Make a map of your thinking process and then summarize and critique it.

    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>
    <div class="mermaid">
      graph TD;
          A[what is the key component to a healthy society??] --> B[Life expectancy];
          A --> C[Quality of Life];
          A --> D[Economic Prosperity];

          B --> B2[See 1. ];

          C --> C2[See 2. ];

          D -->D2[See 3.];

        <li>Places like Japan can be known for its beautiful city and old population. When seeing this one can think about if 
          alot of the population is old then the country must be one where the population is living a long and fruitful life. But on the other hand
        knowing the context of this life expectancy, having a aging population isn't as enjoyable for all involved.  </li>
          <li> In a similar fashion the USA was once thought to have a fantastic quality of life. In some countries they legit think roads are made of 
            gold and that the average person would be a rich (or at least very well) person in their home country. As one who lives in the US, this should
        not be expected. This line of thinking doesn't benefits the naive coming to this country and it doesn't benefit the people living here currently.</li>
        <li> This one is similar to Quality of Life but this idea is a considerable board term. I choose it because once again the USE was once thought to be
            the most economically prosperous country in the world. But as of late this has not been the case. Maybe due to the country being so economically prosperous. 
        </li>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Prompt 4: </h3>

    <h5 style="text-align: left;">Collaboration</h5>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;" >
        Consider some of your recent group work. Did you all have a work management plan? 
        If yes, describe and critique it. If no, would a plan have helped, and what would a good work plan have looked like?
    </p>

    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li> Say when I consider group work done in my Modern Optics lab. My partner and I generally do not have a game plan. But a good game plan would look 
            both of use reading up on the lab report before we get to class then for labs where there are more then one portion, we could split up the work and
            at the end we could describe to each other what it is we worked on and how to think abou the theory behind it all.
          </li>
        
    </ul>
